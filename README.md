Some example web pages created for FreeCodeCamp's Legacy Responsive Web Design Certification

------

In this repository you will find some example webpages made in simple HTML and CSS around 2020 when I had finished uni and was starting to look at coding certifications. Unfortunately, due to account migrations, some webpages and some code has been lost. I have tried to group the projects with their source code where possible.
